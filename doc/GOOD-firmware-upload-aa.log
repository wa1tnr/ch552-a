Although this log looked good; further testing showed that something
in the Arduino IDE 2.x toolchain was not applied to the arduino-cli
build (and upload, as shown above) for a functional system.

TODO:
Clock frequency seems likely.  There's as many as 3 custom settings
in the Arduino IDE that may need to be 'activated' in arduino-cli
